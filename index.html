      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Knowledge is power so in order to make any reasonable amount of change, we need to educate the masses. This includes basic life skills and job skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Outreach:</strong> Guidance is necessary for improvement. The system is complicated so it helps when you have people who can help you navigate.</li>
        <li><strong>Jobs:</strong> One of our goals is to make each person self-sufficient. Job listings that are applicable to each person’s situation and skills can be the difference between sustained employment and reentering the system.</li>
